Binary search is a fast search algorithm used to find a specific item in a sorted array. It works by repeatedly dividing the search interval in half. It compares the target value with the middle element of the array. If they match, the search is successful. If the target value is less than the middle element, the search continues on the lower half of the array; otherwise, it continues on the upper half. This process repeats until the target value is found or the search interval is empty. Binary search has a time complexity of O(log n), making it efficient for large datasets.
